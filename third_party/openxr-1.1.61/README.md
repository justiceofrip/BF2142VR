# Khronos OpenXR SDK 1.1.61

BFVR vendors the official generated C headers needed by the native x86
bootstrap. The headers and the paired `runtime\openxr\win32\openxr_loader.dll`
are from the stable `release-1.1.61` package published by Khronos on 2026-07-06.

BFVR loads the x86 loader by an explicit path below its own folder. The loader
selects the user-configured system OpenXR runtime; BFVR does not ship, register,
or alter a headset runtime.

The bootstrap intentionally creates no session, graphics binding, swapchain,
input action, or composition layer. It is safe to run without a headset and is
only an API/lifecycle readiness check.
