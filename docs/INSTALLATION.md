# Installing BFVR v1.0.2

This guide assumes no modding or programming experience.

## Before installing

1. Make sure ordinary Battlefield 1942 starts successfully without BFVR.
2. Install BF42++ as described below.
3. Close Battlefield 1942 and any older BFVR programs.
4. Connect your headset and make sure its normal PC VR software works.

BFVR requires 64-bit Windows 10 or Windows 11. It does not include Battlefield
1942 or any Battlefield game files.

## Choosing a Battlefield 1942 version

For the easiest currently supported setup, the Moongamers Battlefield 1942
versions are recommended. BFVR has also worked with several retail, digital,
and community-modified releases, but their executable and graphics-wrapper
differences can require additional compatibility work.

BFVR is planned to eventually be bundled with the Battlefield 1942 VKHD
installers. Until that integration is available, install BFVR separately using
the instructions below.

## Install BF42++ first

BFVR currently requires BF42++ to keep Battlefield 1942 in the same working
game process when a map starts. BF42++ is maintained separately and is not
included in the BFVR installer.

First look in the folder containing `BF1942.exe`:

- If it already contains `dsound.dll`, the game package may already include a
  BF42++ proxy. Do not add another BF42++ copy yet. Install BFVR and let its
  launcher inspect that file safely.
- If it does not contain a bundled BF42++ proxy, install the official package
  as described below.

1. Download BF42++ 2.0 RC6, or a newer compatible release, from the
   [official BF42++ page](https://www.moddb.com/games/battlefield-1942/addons/bf42plusplus-v2-0-rc6).
2. Extract all BF42++ installation files into the folder containing
   `BF1942.exe`. Keep their original names, including `bf42++.exe`,
   `bf42++.dll`, and `bf42++BlackScreen.exe`.
3. Start `bf42++.exe` once by itself to confirm BF42++ works, then exit the
   game. When using VR afterward, start `BFVR.exe`; BFVR performs BF42++'s DLL
   loading step before it loads BFVR.

Do not rename `bf42++.dll` yourself. Some community game packages deliberately
ship BF42++ as `dsound.dll`; BFVR can recognize that proxy structurally and use
it without loading a second BF42++ copy. An unfamiliar future proxy is allowed
with a warning rather than blocked by an exact file-version check. The one
specifically known obsolete BF42Plus 1.3.4 `dsound.dll` remains blocked because
its abandoned updater is unsafe.

If both a recognized bundled BF42++ `dsound.dll` and a separately copied
`bf42++.dll` are present, BFVR 1.0.2 prioritizes the bundled proxy and does not
inject the extra DLL. This prevents the duplicate from breaking BFVR, but the
extra BF42++ files are unnecessary and can make ordinary non-VR troubleshooting
more confusing. The simplest setup is to keep only the BF42++ form originally
provided by the game package.

## Install with the setup program

1. Download `BFVR-Setup-v1.0.2.exe` from the official v1.0.2 GitHub Release.
2. Double-click the downloaded installer.
3. Because the installer is unsigned, Windows may say **Unknown publisher**.
   If SmartScreen appears, choose **More info**, verify that the filename and
   published SHA-256 checksum match the official release, and then choose
   **Run anyway**.
4. Select your Battlefield 1942 folder. This is the folder containing
   `BF1942.exe`. The installer creates a new `BFVR` folder inside it. If Setup
   cannot see a separate `bf42++.dll`, it explains what it found but does not
   block installation; the BFVR launcher performs the more careful proxy check.
5. Optionally create a desktop shortcut, then finish the installation.

The installer confirms that the selected folder contains `BF1942.exe`, but it
does not restrict the executable to one exact version. Battlefield 1942 has
several retail, digital, and community-modified executables. Some may require
additional compatibility work because BFVR connects to internal game code.

## Select the OpenXR runtime

OpenXR lets one BFVR build work with different headset systems. Windows has one
active OpenXR runtime at a time, and BFVR automatically uses it. There is no
`bfvr.toml` file and no separate SteamVR edition.

### Meta Quest Link or Air Link

Open the Meta Quest Link PC application and make the Meta/Oculus runtime active
in its OpenXR settings if it is not already active. Connect Link or Air Link
before starting BFVR.

### SteamVR

Start SteamVR and connect the headset. In the small SteamVR desktop window,
open the menu, choose **Settings**, then **OpenXR**. If SteamVR is not shown as
the current OpenXR runtime, choose **Set SteamVR as OpenXR Runtime**.

The OpenXR loader always uses the currently active runtime; this selection is
owned by the headset software, not BFVR. See the
[Khronos OpenXR loader documentation](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenXR/specs/1.1/loader.html)
for the underlying standard behavior.

### Virtual Desktop (Quest/Pico)

1. Open **Virtual Desktop Streamer** on the PC.
2. In its OpenXR runtime setting, select **VDXR** or
   **VirtualDesktopXR** instead of SteamVR.
3. Connect to the PC from the Virtual Desktop headset application.
4. Start `BFVR.exe` from the connected PC desktop.

Virtual Desktop's own overlay should show `Runtime: VDXR`. BFVR asks for
OpenXR 1.0 and D3D11, which match VDXR's published implementation. If startup
fails, include BFVR's presenter log and Virtual Desktop's
`%ProgramData%\Virtual Desktop\OpenXR.log` in the report. A SteamVR-through-
Virtual-Desktop route may also run, but native VDXR avoids the extra SteamVR
layer and is the preferred test path.

## Start BFVR

1. Start and connect your headset software.
2. Double-click the installed **BFVR** shortcut, or open the game's `BFVR`
   folder and double-click `BFVR.exe`.
3. Do not start `BF1942.exe` separately. BFVR starts and manages it.
4. Use Battlefield 1942's normal menu to load a map.

BFVR temporarily skips the old Bink intro movie because that renderer path is
not VR-compatible. The movie is restored when the game exits. BFVR does not
overwrite it.

## Updating

Close BFVR, run the newer installer, and choose the same game folder. The
installer replaces BFVR program files but preserves your `UserConfig.txt`.

## Uninstalling

Open Windows **Installed apps** (or **Apps & features**), select **BFVR**, and
choose **Uninstall**. The uninstaller asks whether to remove your saved BFVR
settings. It removes BFVR files and shortcuts without removing Battlefield
1942, BF42++, or any game data.
